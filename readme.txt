We have done this work together because we are in the same student residence.
It was easy to work because for us it's always better to see in face to face and share our ideas in direct.

What we have done and completed :
- An opening menu that ask if we are a Bank Employee or a Customer
- Then 2 differents menus for on one side the customers and on the other side the employees
- To successfully login as an employee with the pin 'A123' 
- Different options for the employees : seefile, newclient, transaction, delete, exit
- To successfully login as a customer with first name, last name, account number and pin
- Different options for the customers : seeaccount, transaction, exit
- An abstract class ActionOnAccount have the methods the client and the employee can access, like showing an account
- A class ActionOnAccountLimited heritates from the ActionOnAccount abtract class, in this class there are only methods that employees can access

What we could not do and difficulties :
- It was a little difficult to find hours to work together that suit us both
- Big difficulties in the beginning on the project to find what we can do for an inheritance class
- Questions about the possibility for a client to carry out transactions between his current account and his savings account
